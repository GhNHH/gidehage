### chameleon-ng

chameleon-ng is an extended version of the [Chameleon](https://github.com/aixxe/Chameleon) project, an internal skin & knife changer for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Like the original project, the code contains extensive comments intended for those new to game manipulation.

**Make sure to enable** `net_graph` **or** `cl_showfps` **if the menu is not drawing in-game.**

* Allows usage of skins on any weapon without restrictions.
* Includes primitive fix for special knife animations.
* Full in-game graphical interface for configuration.
* Network variable offsets are retrieved at runtime.
* Ability to override weapon kill feed icons.
* Persistent JSON configuration files.
* Button to instantly apply changes.

## Usage

Download the source code at the [Releases](https://github.com/emskye96/chameleon-ng/releases) page or clone the repository with submodules.

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/emskye96/chameleon-ng.git
```

Compile with Visual Studio and inject the output DLL with your preferred injector. Note that usage of some public injectors can result in a Valve Anti-Cheat ban. It is highly recommended to use your own DLL injector.

Once injected, press the <kbd>Insert</kbd> key to open the configuration menu.

Use the 'Items' header to set weapon skins and other related values. For example, to change a default CT knife to a Karambit you would open the 'Knife (Counter-Terrorists)' section, set the override item index to 507 and press apply. Refer to the [full list of skin IDs](https://github.com/adamb70/CSGO-skin-ID-dumper/blob/master/item_index.txt) for possible paint kit values and the [item definition index](https://github.com/emskye96/chameleon-ng/blob/master/src/ItemDefinitions.hpp) list for possible item overrides. The kill icon will automatically be set to the appropriate value based on the override item index.

To save a preset, scroll down to the 'Presets' header, type a filename and press New. After you have made additional changes to the preset you can press the 'Save' button to write your changes to the file.

To load a preset, simply click the 'Load' button below the specified preset. By default this will only overwrite skins specified in the preset. If you want to reset everything else while loading a preset make sure to check the 'Reset settings on load' box.
